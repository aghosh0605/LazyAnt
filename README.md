# LazyAnt

We all human being are lazy. So, we made this tool to make a windows user happy. Some of the hidden function we need are hard to find. This tool will help you to find all the info that are not pretty simple to find.

# How to run :)

Run this as Administrator because some of the info needs administrator permissions to work properly.

# Focus

We want to make GUI as well as support on every platform including CLI and GUI packages that can be used portablely without installation.

We will be very happy if you contribute, find bugs or give us ideas about various features.
